#INTRODUCTION
The consumer Packaged Goods Industry is highly competitive and fast-moving, especially in the personal care segment. Soap and skincare products, which form a crucial part of everyday hygiene routines, experience frequent changes in consumer preferences, brand loyalty, and regional demand. For business to remain profitable, they must monitor sales trends, identify top-performing products, and understand regional market differences.
This project aims to analyze soap and skincare product sales across multiple regions and brands, using Excel tools such as formulas, pivot tables, and interactive dashboards. The goal is to generate actionable and inventory decisions.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Despite increasing demand for hygiene and skincare products, many businesses struggle with identifying which product categories and brands are performing well across different regions. There is also limited visibility into seasonal sales trends, pricing effects, and regional demand fluctuations. Without proper analysis, companies risk stock imbalances, missed opportunities, and ineffective marketing campaigns.
This analysis seeks to uncover sales patterns across brands and regions to support date-driven decision-making in marketing, supply chain, and product development.
